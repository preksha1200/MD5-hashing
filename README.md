# MD5 hashing
This code takes an MD5 hash and compares it with a library of more than 10,00,000 and finally decrypts the hash and presents the encrypted word/password.


Simple python program that uses CLI interface to decrypt MD5 hashes in an easy and efficient way. Small tweaks to the program can change it to other forms of encryption such as SHA256 as well.
